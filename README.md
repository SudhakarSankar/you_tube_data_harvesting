ðŸ“º YouTube Data Harvesting and Warehousing using SQL and Streamlit
ðŸ“Œ Project Overview
This project enables users to extract, manage, and analyze YouTube channel data using the YouTube Data API v3. The data is stored in a SQL data warehouse (MySQL/PostgreSQL), and the entire functionality is provided via an interactive Streamlit web application.

ðŸ§  Skills Gained
Python Scripting

API Integration (YouTube Data API)

Data Management (SQL: MySQL / PostgreSQL)

Streamlit Application Development

SQL Queries and Data Analysis

ðŸ§° Tech Stack
Python (Pandas, Requests, SQLAlchemy)

Streamlit (Frontend Web App)

YouTube Data API v3

MySQL / PostgreSQL (Data Storage)

Pickle (For temporary storage)

ðŸŽ¯ Problem Statement
Build a user-friendly Streamlit app that:

Accepts a YouTube Channel ID and fetches channel + video data using the YouTube API

Allows users to store data for up to 10 channels

Saves and manages the data using MySQL or PostgreSQL

Offers a way to query and analyze the data using pre-defined SQL queries

Displays query results and insights directly within the app

ðŸ§­ Project Workflow
ðŸ“‹ Step-by-Step Workflow
User inputs a YouTube Channel ID in the Streamlit app.

API Request is sent to the YouTube Data API v3 to collect:

Channel details (name, description, subscriber count, etc.)

Playlist ID (upload playlist)

All video IDs from the playlist

Each videoâ€™s metadata (views, likes, duration, etc.)

Top-level comments on each video

Data is temporarily stored in memory using Pandas DataFrames.

Data Cleaning & Structuring:

Missing/null values handled

Columns renamed/formatted

Nested structures (comments, tags) flattened

Data is migrated to SQL database (MySQL or PostgreSQL):

Channel table

Playlist table

Video table

Comment table

SQL Queries are executed based on user selections in the app:

Example: Most viewed videos, channel with most uploads, etc.

Query results are displayed in Streamlit as interactive tables.

(Optional): Export results or visualize them using graphs.
